# Dime Game

the objective of this project is to create a game using the dime modeling environment.

# My requirements

my objective is to use dime as much as possible and only use java for parts which are too complex for dime alone

# the game

the game I have chosen to implement is [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)

this is a well known game where the user must guess the "word of the day"

the user gets a limited amount of tries/

the user inputs a word. the word must be a word inside a word list even if its not the "word of the day"

the correct letters entered which are in the right place get highlighted
