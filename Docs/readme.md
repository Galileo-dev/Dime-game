## Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a game using [DIME](https://gitlab.com/scce/dime), a software platform for creating interactive multimedia applications. We have chosen to create a version of the popular word guessing game, [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

## Game Description
In Wordle, the objective is to correctly guess the "word of the day" within a limited number of tries. The game consists of a 5 by 6 grid, in which the player can input six letter words. The grid will highlight letters in green if they are correctly placed in the answer word, and yellow if they are present in the answer word but not in the correct position. There is also a random word generator which will change the answer word each time the game is played.

To play the game, the player must input a word using the provided grid. The inputted word must be a valid word according to a pre-determined word list, even if it is not the "word of the day". The correct letters that are correctly placed in the answer word will be highlighted in green, while letters that are present in the answer word but not in the correct position will be highlighted in yellow. The player has a limited number of tries to correctly guess the "word of the day".
