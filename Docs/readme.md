## Contents

the objective of this project is to create a game using [DIME](https://gitlab.com/scce/dime). we choose to implement [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).
Our Dime game require a 5 by 6 box which allowed the user to input six letter words with 6 attempts. The grid must turn green for the letters which match with the answer and yellow with the letters which are somewhere else in the word. There also needs to be a random word generator which would change the answer word every time.



## Description


this is a well known game where the user must guess the "word of the day" with the following rules
- the user gets a limited amount of tries
- the user inputs a word. the word must be a word inside a word list even if its not the "word of the day"
- the correct letters entered which are in the right place get highlighted
